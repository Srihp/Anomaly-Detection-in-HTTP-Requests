# Anomaly-Detection-in-HTTP-Requests
HTTP requests are a leading method which the attacker exploit to target a system. In order to safeguard against such attacks we will implement machine learning techniques that can analyse a request and classify them as if whether they are safe or not. In this project I have used 4 different machine learning models in order to determine the best algorithm and have also visualised the result of each algorithm.  


A Python script that uses the HTTP Server log files, to analyse and test several different machine learning model that is best suited for the task of analysing 
HTTp requests in real time and hence classifying them as either safe or malicious.
